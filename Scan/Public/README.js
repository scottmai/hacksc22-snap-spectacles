/*

Welcome to the Scan template!

Please read this doc before getting started to explore the template!

------

In this template, we pull information from a remote server
which sends results of currently scanned objects/dogs/cars/places.

---USER AUTHORIZATION---

Because we need user's authorization to use the scan feature,
so in any project using the scan feature we'll have to check if
user has given permission to scan, if not we should include the response
telling user this lens is not working as it's supposed to be
because scan permission has been denied.

Please keep the PermissionCheck object turned on in order for
this feature to work!

Check out the Scan Template docmentation page at:
https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/interactive/scan
for more info!

---USING SCAN EXAMPLES---

Be aware there should only be ONE EXAMPLE RUNNING AT ONE TIME

if you get the warning saying 'Scan failure: Scanning too frequently'
try to refresh with only one example enabled

Some of the examples like '4.Get Car Price' are best when used on mobile
devices around real life settings. Please use the 'Send to Snapchat' button
on the top right corner to test the template on the Snapchat app
in order to get the best scan experience!
